issues.\n\n--- Chunk 164 ---\n- After waiting at least 90 seconds and trying the brake action again, the booster should provide two or more vacuum assisted pedal applications. If vacuum assist is not provided, perform booster and check valve vacuum tests.\n- To test the power booster check valve, disconnect the vacuum hose, remove the check valve and valve seal, and apply 15-20 inches of vacuum at the large end of the check valve. The vacuum should hold steady, and if there is any vacuum loss, the valve is faulty and must be replaced.\n- To test the power booster vacuum, connect a vacuum gauge to the check valve with a short length of hose and a T-fitting, start and run the engine at idle for one minute, clamp the hose shut, and observe the vacuum gauge. If the vacuum drops more than one inch within 15 seconds, either the booster diaphragm or check valve are faulty.\n- On diesel engine models, a low vacuum condition in the brake booster will cause the brake warning light to illuminate. Check the vacuum pump output and condition of hoses to diagnose a low vacuum condition. Run the engine at idle speed and throttle and ensure the vacuum ranges from 8.5 to 25 inches and holds steady. If vacuum output is low or does not hold steady, vacuum hoses and/or pump are faulty.\n\n--- Chunk 165 ---\nThis section of the vehicle service manual provides information on the master cylinder of the vehicle.

A speed sensor transmits speed and deceleration inputs to the electronic control module using an exciter ring on the differential case. The amber antilock warning lamp alerts the driver of any system malfunctions.

The tone wheel for the front speed sensor is located in the rotor hub on 2-wheel drive models and is not serviceable. On 4-wheel drive models, the tone wheel is located on the driveshaft. For rear speed sensor removal and installation, the vehicle must be raised on a hoist and the sensor, cover, and sensor mounting area should be cleaned. The rear speed sensor harness can be replaced by raising the vehicle, disconnecting the wire harness at the sensor, and installing and connecting a new rear harness. The ABS system brake bleeding should be done using Mopar DOT 3 brake fluid or an equivalent meeting SAE J1703-F and DOT 3 standards. Bleeding can be done manually, with vacuum equipment, or with pressure equipment, with manual bleeding being preferred. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper bleeding when using vacuum or pressure equipment.\n\n--- Chunk 201 ---\n- Manual bleeding is preferred when bleeding the brake system, but if vacuum or pressure equipment is used, follow manufacturers' instructions for proper results. \n- Vacuum bleeding does not require the front brake metering valve to be held open, but pressure equipment does.\n- Recommended bleeding sequence: master cylinder, rear antilock valve, combination valve, front antilock valve, left rear wheel, right rear wheel, right front wheel, left front wheel.\n- Bleed one valve or wheel brake unit at a time using a bleed hose and a glass container partially filled with brake fluid to catch air bubbles.\n- Keep the end of the bleed hose immersed in fluid to prevent air from being drawn back into the system.\n- Check the master cylinder fluid level frequently and add fluid as needed to avoid introducing air into the system.\n- If the master cylinder has been overhauled or replaced, bleed it on the bench before installation to shorten bleed time and ensure proper operation.\n- If the master cylinder was not serviced, clean the reservoir and cover before filling it with Mopar, DOT 3 brake fluid and bleeding the system.\n\n--- Chunk 202 ---\nThis section of the vehicle service manual provides detailed instructions on how to bleed the brake system, including cleaning the reservoir and cover, filling it with DOT 3 brake fluid, opening all caliper and wheel cylinder bleed screws, bleeding the master cylinder, RWAL and combination valves, and the front antilock valve.

Rotor braking surfaces should not be machined unless necessary, and rotors should be replaced if severely scored, tapered, cracked, or warped. Rotor thickness variation should be checked at multiple points around the rotor face, and excessive variation may require rotor replacement.

Two forces affect the brake shoes: hydraulic pressure from wheel cylinder pistons and friction generated by the rotating drum.\n- The servo action of the brake system creates increased force on the drum braking surface by wedging the brake shoes against the drum.\n- Drum brake assemblies on BR models are equipped with a self-adjusting mechanism to compensate for lining wear.\n- The adjuster mechanism maintains proper brakeshoe operating clearance and brake pedal height by adjusting the shoes in small increments during reverse stops.\n- Secondary brakeshoe movement during reverse stops activates the adjuster components, allowing for continuous adjustment throughout the life of the brake lining.\n\n--- Chunk 217 ---\n- The adjuster components for the brake lining are connected to the secondary brakeshoes.\n- Adjustment only occurs during reverse brake stops, when secondary brakeshoe movement activates the adjuster components.\n- Adjuster lever spring exerts pull on the lever, pivoting it away from the adjuster screw teeth during operation.\n- Adjustment occurs during the return movement of the lever after a complete stop, with the lever rotating the adjuster screw one or two teeth as needed.\n- Rolling stops will not activate the adjuster components for adjustment.\n- Brakeshoe removal process involves raising the vehicle, removing rear wheels and brake drums, and

The Cold Cranking Amperage (CCA) rating measures the current a battery can deliver at cold temperatures, while the Reserve Capacity (RC) rating estimates how long a battery can last after a charging system failure. Models with a diesel engine have two batteries, one for the intake manifold air heater and one for other electrical requirements.

When the ignition switch is released, the relay contacts open, de-energizing the solenoid and disengaging the starter. The starter motor and solenoid must be replaced as a complete assembly if either component fails. Before removing any unit for repair, perform inspections on the battery, wiring, solenoid, relay, and ignition switch to determine their condition. If the starter fails to engage, possible causes and corrections are listed, including checking the battery, testing the starting circuit wiring, and testing or replacing the relay if needed.\n\n--- Chunk 327 ---\nThis section of the vehicle service manual provides information on diagnosing issues with the starting system of a vehicle.

A malfunctioning EGR system can cause engine knocking, rough idle, stalling, and poor driveability. The system includes an EGR valve assembly, EGR valve control with a back-pressure transducer and electric vacuum solenoid, powertrain control module (PCM), EGR tube, and hoses. The PCM controls the operation of the EGR valve based on engine temperatures, throttle positions, and other conditions. If the electrical connection to the EGR valve control is lost, the valve may operate at all times, leading to poor engine performance. The back-pressure transducer operates the EGR valve based on exhaust pressure, with exhaust delivered through the EGR tube.\n\n--- Chunk 1362 ---\nThe section of the vehicle service manual discusses the EGR valve and back-pressure in the engine. The EGR valve control regulates exhaust gas recirculation based on back-pressure levels. Exhaust gas recirculation begins when the PCM determines it is necessary, the EGR valve control is not energized, and back-pressure is strong enough.
